<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Linux is an open source operating system (OS).</li>
<li>Linux was designed to be similar to UNIX, but has evolved to run on a wide variety of hardware from phones to supercomputers. Every Linux-based OS involves the Linux kernel - which manages hardware resources - and a set of software packages that make up the rest of the operating system.
(<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-linux">https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-linux</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unix</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>UNIX is an operating system which was first developed in the 1960s, and has been under constant development ever since. By operating system, we mean the suite of programs which make the computer work. It is a stable, multi-user, multi-tasking system for servers, desktops and laptops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UNIX systems also have a graphical user interface (GUI) similar to Microsoft Windows which provides an easy to use environment. However, knowledge of UNIX is required for operations which aren&rsquo;t covered by a graphical program, or for when there is no windows interface available, for example, in a telnet session.

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>So Linux is a Unix?</strong>
<strong>Linux cannot be said to be Unix</strong> mainly because it was written from scratch. It does not have any original Unix code within. Looking at the two OS, you may not notice much of a difference as Linux was designed to function just like Unix, but it does not contain any of its code. Moreover, it lacks a Unix Certification to satisfy the conditions of being called a Unix OS as aforementioned.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ubuntu is a Linux.</strong>
Ubuntu is a Linux distribution based on Debian and composed mostly of free and open-source software.</li>
<li><strong>CentOS</strong>
Also known as CentOS Linux, is a Linux distribution that provides a free and open-source community-supported computing platform, functionally compatible with its upstream source.</li>
<li><strong>Linux distros</strong>
<ul>
<li>A Linux distribution (Distro) is a collection of applications, packages, package managers, and features that run on the Linux kernel, so the Linux kernel is shared among distributions – there are sometimes this kernel is customized according to the organization that maintains the distribution.</li>
<li>Some Distro Linux: Redhat, CentOS, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu.</li>

<h5 id="the-shell">The Shell</h5>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Bash vs Zsh vs Terminal vs Sh vs&hellip;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bash</strong> is the abbreviation of the Bourne-again shell. In 1971, the UNIX operating system was released along with the Thompson shell. In 1979, the Thompson shell was modified and released as a Bourne shell. Brian Fox released Bash in 1989 for his project that provided improvements from its previous versions. Bash release enhanced its use as a scripting language.</li>
<li><strong>Zsh</strong> is called Z Shell, which is an extension of Bash that has many new features and themes. Zsh was released in 1990 by Paul Falstad. Zsh has similarities with Korn shell as well. Linux and Mac OS use Bash as their default shell.</li>
<li><strong>Terminal</strong> A terminal is a text input and output environment. A terminal window, also known as a terminal emulator, is a text-only window that emulates a console in a graphical user interface (GUI).</li>
<li><strong>Sh</strong> utility is a command language interpreter/a command that executes commands read from a command line string, the standard input, or a specified file. The application ensures that the commands to be executed are expressed in the language described in Shell Command Language.</li>
