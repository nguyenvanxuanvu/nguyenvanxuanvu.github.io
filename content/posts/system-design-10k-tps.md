## 1. Introduction

First of all, a blog (a shortened version of “weblog”) is an online journal or informational website displaying information in reverse chronological order, with the latest posts appearing first, at the top. It is a platform where a writer or a group of writers share their views on an individual subject.

Today, there are more than 570 million blogs on the web.

**And what is the purpose of a blog?**

The main purpose of a blog is to connect you to the relevant audience. Another one is to boost your traffic and send quality leads to your website.

So to grow in the long term and connect with more people, you need a system that can handle a large and effective traffic for your blog/homepage. 

And in this blog, specific to the problem here is **10000 transactions per second (10k tps)**. 

To do that, let's work together to find solutions for your own system.

## 2. Point out the problems

After researching and asking some more experienced people, I think to build the system as mentioned above, we will encounter 2 main types of problems:
- **About product (blog):**
  - Your blog is for the purpose of reading articles only ?
  - In addition to serving articles, you are also welcome to allow your readers to send you messages or do other things such as donate ?
- **About technology:**
  - what technologies help your system achieve 10k tps ?

In this post, I choose to build a system for reading blogs. Other post data-oriented features such as sending messages or donations will be expanded in the future. 

As for the technology used and the specifics of the system, let's go to the next sections of the blog
